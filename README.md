# LP_MF_ADV
A thesis project about the study and development of a machine-learning algorithm to predict links with adversarial regularization.
Here you can find:
A- Cross-Validation code B- Final Model code C- Attack code
These three steps are available for 2 graph datasets:
1- Conflict -Topological Information -Moniadic Information -Dyadic Information
2- Facebook -Topological Information -Moniadic Information
In the root of the repo, you can find a PDF containing the thesis relations containing studies, mathematical base of the algorithms, experiments and conclusions
